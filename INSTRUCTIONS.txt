This program was developed as an extension of code developed my Dave Tiddeman of the Met Office's Aerosol Group.
The file GUI.py was was created to aid in the development of a GUI for viewing of data from a LIDAR tool which the
Met Office has access to. LIDAR stands for Light Detection and Ranging, the tool the Met Office have access to is
mounted on an aeroplane which aims laser light beams at the ground and determines what is below the plane based on
how much light is reflected back.

Sample data files are provided along with this code in the netCDF format. They sample files are titled
metoffice-lidar_faam_20150807_r0_B920_raw.nc and metoffice-lidar_faam_20150812_r0_B924_raw.nc. The default behaviour
of the code relies on these data files being in the same folder as GUI.py.

The files GUI.py, test_GUI.py, environment.yml, conda-spec-file.txt, FUTURE_DEVELOPMENTS.txt and INSTRUCTIONS.txt were
all completely written by me Luke Carroll for the module CO880 at the University of Kent. The rest of the files were
created by the Met Office in collaboration with the National Centre for Atmospheric Science. I did change an import in
the file lidar_aux.py and an import in lidar_raw.py. These changes were to make the code compatible with Python 3. I
also changed line 89 in lidar.py from 'mo=re.search('[abcdABCD]\d\d\d.',data)' to
'mo=re.search(r'[abcdABCD]\d\d\d.',data)'. This change was to avoid a deprecation warning. All of the changes can be
seen at https://github.com/LukeC92/ez-lidar-python/tree/guiDev2 .

Instructions for Best Running of Program:
-----------------------------------------
This program depends on a few key packages. A full break down of the environments I used can be found in
environment.yml and conda-spec-file.txt. To best replicate the environments for this software I would recommend
Anaconda (shortened to conda), the Python environment manager. With conda installed the my envrionment can be
replicated with the following commands.

        conda create --name lidarENV python=3.6 matplotlib=2.2 numpy=1.14
        conda install netCDF4
        conda install scipy
        conda install jupyter
        conda install pytest

Once your environment is set up the file GUI.py and test_GUI.py can be ran from the command line. test_GUI.py can be
ran using the command "pytest test_GUI.py" the flag -v can be useful in this instance. The tests should take around
30 seconds to run.

Below are key points to undertand when running GUI.py:

1. Running the default option of "python GUI.py" should take about 4 seconds to produce a figure.
2. The default settings plots a graph representing the lidar data from the file
metoffice-lidar_faam_20150807_r0_B920_raw.nc, it plots data between 14:24:01 and 14:31:00 on 7 August 2015.
3. It is possible to set several options for the program, information on these options can be found by typing
"python GUI.py -h"
4. The sample data is extremely large and certain options can result in a severe run time.
5. Setting the the start and end to be an hour apart will result in the code taking 20 seconds to plot a graph.
6. Setting the plot_choice to PCOLOR will result in it taking 50 seconds to produce a graph with the default data
range. Given that this is a 7 minute interval it is not recommended to use PCOLOR for larger ranges.
7. On the plot there are 'Next' and 'Previous' buttons. This will replot the data 100 "moments" further along (this
corresponds to 3.5 minutes on average). Pressing 'Next' or 'Previous' completely reruns the calculations and plots, so it
will take the same amount of time as your original command call. Hence it's a good idea to not plot a wide range
of data if you are going to use the Next and Previous buttons.
8. Other command line options include the channel. This corresponds to a channel within the LIDAR measuring tool that
was used to create the data. Changing the channel from 0 to 1 or 2 will result in other data being plotted.
9. It is possible to set the date at the command line, however this is not recommended. Both the sample data files
have data restricted to a single day, which the program finds automatically. The date option was included incase
other files from the Met Office have data from several dates. Setting the date with the data available will either
do nothing, raise a warning or raise an error.
10a) The file metoffice-lidar_faam_20150807_r0_B920_raw.nc has data from the times 11:31:15 to 18:24:38. Therefore
start and end should be set to between these limits. This data was collected on 7 August 2015.
10b) The file metoffice-lidar_faam_20150812_r0_B924_raw.nc has data from the times 13:54:27 to 19:01:35. Therefore
start and end should be set to between these limits. This data was collected on 12 August 2015.
11. As oart of the Next and Previous method the colorbar of the graph is deleted and replotted. For some reason this
does not properly work with the contourf plot_option. Instead the graph gets compressed into a smaller and smaller
space.
